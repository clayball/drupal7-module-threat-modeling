  - What are the modules dependencies? Drupal, etc.

  - Does it except inputs; are there entry points for an attack?

  - Is secure information needed, ie User credentials/personal info

  - What permissions does the module operate under?


##  Determine and rank threats

- List found problems in code

-  Rank threats


##  Determine countermeasures and mitigation
